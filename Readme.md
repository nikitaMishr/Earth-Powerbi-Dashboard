EarthPulse is a multi-page Power BI dashboard exploring three major environmental challenges our planet faces:

- **CO₂ Emissions**
- **Deforestation**
- **Light Pollution**

Each topic has its own dedicated page with interactive visuals, filters, and clean layouts — designed to give users a clear picture of how these issues evolve over time and across countries.

## 📁 Project Contents

- **Power BI dashboard file:** `Earth_Dashboard.pbix`
- **Cleaned datasets** for CO₂, deforestation, and light pollution in CSV format
- **Custom visuals and artwork** to give each page a unique style


## 🔍 What You’ll See in the Dashboard

### 🌫 CO₂ Emissions Page

Tracks CO₂ levels from 2015 to 2022, featuring KPIs and line/bar charts comparing actual levels to target values. The left side shows a static globe image for design.
